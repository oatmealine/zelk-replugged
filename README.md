<div align=center><h1>Zelk</h1>
<p>
Zelk is a smooth Discord theme inspired by the <a href=https://github.com/ZorinOS/zorin-desktop-themes>Zorin GTK theme</a>. This is an up-to-date, personal fork of <a href="https://github.com/schnensch0/zelk/">the original Zelk</a> that aims to fix some dissatisfactions I've had with the theme.
